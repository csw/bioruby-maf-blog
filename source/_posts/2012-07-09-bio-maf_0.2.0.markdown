I have released [bio-maf][] version 0.2.0 as a Ruby gem. The main new
feature in this release is MAF 'tiling'; combining the alignment
blocks covering a given genomic interval, optionally filling in gaps
with reference sequence data, to output a single alignment block. See
the [README][] for more details. This includes a [maf_tile(1)][]
tool. The name of this feature, and inspiration for the
implementation, comes from the [bx-python][] implementation.

This release also enables [gap removal][] in cases where removal of
some species from an alignment block leaves a gap in all remaining sequences.

Other fixes and improvements include:

* [#59](https://github.com/csw/bioruby-maf/issues/59): returning
  blocks in sorted order
* [#56](https://github.com/csw/bioruby-maf/issues/56): avoiding a
  race condition in parallel parsing
* Using all available cores by default under JRuby
